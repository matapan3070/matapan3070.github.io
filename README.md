# Helmet Detection

## Introduction to Object Detection:

Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Object detection algorithms typically leverage machine learning or deep learning to produce meaningful results. The goal of object detection is to detect and classify objects within an image, and to locate the position of the objects within the image.

Object detection is important for a variety of reasons. For example, detecting the bikers who are wearing helmets or not wearing. Some potential benefits of helmet detection include:

1.Improved safety: By detecting whether or not a person is wearing a helmet, safety systems can alert the user or take corrective action if necessary. This could be particularly useful in industries with a high risk of head injuries, such as construction or cycling.

2.Enhanced compliance: In industries or situations where helmet use is required by law or regulation, helmet detection can be used to ensure compliance.

3.Increased efficiency: In some cases, helmet detection can be used to automate tasks or processes that require the presence or absence of a helmet. For example, a helmet detection system could be used to control access to a construction site or to trigger the start of a manufacturing process.

## Object Detection Using Deep Learning:
We can use a variety of techniques to perform object detection. Popular deep learningâ€“based approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as R-CNN and YOLO, automatically learn to detect objects within images. One of the most famous families of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DNN) for object detection is the YOLO (You Only Look Once).

### Problem:
The problem of people not using helmet while driving has caused the increase in number of accidents therefore it is necessary to solve the problem and this can be solved by using machine learning to detect the helmets of the riders both considering the bike riders and bycycle riders. The problem is solved by the method of implementation of CNN layered technique.

### Data:

The data was custom made by collecting the images from internet using the online repositories. The data had the diversity and variation to detect any possible kind of scenario of person wearing helment. The data consisted of two classes of person riding the bike and bycycles with helmet and without helmet. The custom object detection dataset (image & bounding box text file) can be accessed from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hxUF7z20tghwRWZiHh7j7qm_uti-030y/view?usp=share_link

### Method:

Yolo is the most widely used machine learning algorithm for the detection and prediction applications. This project consists of the custom dataset and the annotations were carried out using labalimg toolbox. This model is specifically designed in a manner to detect the bounding boxes for the training and the training of the bounding boxes resulted in prediction of the helmets/no helmets in the project. The bounding boxes of the images were created using the Labelimg toolbox. The dataset used for the project consists of the custom image dataset.
